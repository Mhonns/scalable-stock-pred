# Introduction

> Sentiment  analysis,  also  called  opinion  mining,  is  the  field  of  study  that analyzes  people's  opinions,  sentiments,  evaluations,  appraisals,  attitudes, and  emotions  towards  entities  such  as  products,  services,  organizations, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes.

Blah blah [see @Rinker2017, pp. 33-35; also @Rinker2017b, ch. 1]. This template demonstrates some of the basic latex you'll need to know to create a JSS article.

## Code formatting

Don't use markdown, instead use the more precise latex commands:

* \proglang{Java}
* \pkg{plyr}
* \code{print("abc")}

# R code

Can be inserted in regular R markdown blocks.

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x
```
